This is a simple Twitch follower checker.

How to run:
1. set your environment variables for CLIENT_SECRET, TO_ID (you want to check this streamer's followers), and CLIENT_ID (associated with the developer account).
2. run the main.py script and check the generated csv.
3. after a while where some people have followed/unfollowed, run the script again and check the generated diffs.
